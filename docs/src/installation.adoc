= Smarti Installation Guide
:toc: right

== Introduction

Installation packages are provided for https://www.debian.org/[Debian]- and https://www.redhat.com/[RedHat]-based systems.

NOTE: Alternatively the application can be started by directly launching the executable jar: `java -jar smarti-${smarti-version}-exec.jar`, see section <<developers-guide.adoc#,Build and Run>>.

CAUTION: In order to build & run Smarti the <<system-requirements.adoc#,System requirements>> have to be fulfilled.

== Deploy

=== Deploy on Debian

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i ${smarti-source}/dist/target/smarti_${smarti-build-version}.deb
```

=== Deploy on Red Hat

```bash
$ sudo rpm -i ${smarti-source}/dist/target/smarti_${smarti-build-version}.rpm
```

== Changing the User

When installed using one of the provided packages (`deb`, `rpm`), smarti runs as it's own system user `smarti`. This user is created during the installation
process if it does not already exists.

To run smarti as a different user (`assistify` in this example), do the following steps:

. Create the new working-directory
+
```bash
$ mkdir -p /data/smarti
$ chown -R assistify: /data/smarti
```

. Populate the new working-directory with the required configuration files, e.g. by copying the default settings
+
```bash
$ cp /etc/smarti/* /data/smarti
```

. Update the systemd configuration for smarti
+
```bash
$ systemctl edit smarti
```
+
and add the following content
+
```bash
[Service]
User = assistify
WorkingDirectory = /data/smarti
```

. Restart the smarti
+
```bash
$ systemctl try-restart smarti
```


== System maintenance

=== Daemon / Service

==== Configuration

* `/etc/default/smarti`
* JVM and JVM Options (e.g. `-Xmx4g`)
* Program Arguments (overwriting settings from the `application.properties`)

==== Start / Stop / Restart

```bash
$ sudo service smarti [ start | stop | restart  ]
```

==== Status

To check the service status use the daemon

```bash
$ service smarti status
```

This should result in something like

```bash
‚óè smarti.service - smarti
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/smarti.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2017-08-26 12:12:28 UTC; 6s ago
 Main PID: 4606 (bash)
    Tasks: 22
   Memory: 647.8M
      CPU: 12.518s
   CGroup: /system.slice/smarti.service
```

=== Logging

* Working-Directory at `/var/lib/smarti/`
* Log-Files available under `/var/lib/smarti/logs/`, a symlink to `/var/log/smarti/`
* http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Log-Configuration] under `/var/lib/smarti/logback.xml`, a symlink to `/etc/smarti/logback.xml`

NOTE: Please keep in mind, that if smarti runs as a different user it probably also has a custom working directory. In such case, logs are stored in the new working directory (or whatever is configured in the logging-configuration).

To Check if Smarti is started search in `/var/log/smarti/main.log` for something like

```bash
[main] INFO  io.redlink.smarti.Application - smarti started: http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/
```

=== Monitoring

==== System Health

A system-wide health check is available at `http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health`.
In case of any problems you can call this URL in your browser or send a `curl` in order to check if Smarti is up and running.

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health
```

On success, if everything is running it returns: `{"status":"UP"}` else `{"status":"DOWN"}`.

NOTE: `{"status":"DOWN"}` is also reported, if Stanford NLP libraries are not present in the classpath.


=== System Info

You can get a detailed information about the build version that is running by calling
```bash
$ curl -X GET http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/info
```


== Application Configuration

https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html

=== application.properties

./etc/smarti/application.properties
```bash
## logging config file
logging.config = ./logback.xml

## server port
server.port = ${smarti-port}

## mongo-db
#spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://${mongodb-host}/smarti
spring.data.mongodb.database = smarti
#spring.data.mongodb.host = ${mongodb-host}
#spring.data.mongodb.port = ${mongodb-port}
#spring.data.mongodb.password =
#spring.data.mongodb.username =
```


== Third-Party Dependencies and Licenses

When installing via one of the provided packages (`rpm`, `deb`) a list of used third-party libraries and their licenses are available under

* `/usr/share/doc/smarti/THIRD-PARTY.txt` (backend), and
* `/usr/share/doc/smarti/UI-THIRD-PARTY.json` (frontend, UI)

From the running system, similar files are served.

*Backend*

```bash
$ curl http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/THIRD-PARTY.txt
```

*Frontend UI*

```bash
$ curl http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/3rdPartyLicenses.json
```
