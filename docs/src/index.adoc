[abstract]
Smarti is a service component for conversational data. It allows to classify conversation intents, extract entities using
natural language components and makes this data actionable via turning it into queries for an extendable set of endpoints.
In addition Smarti is able to store conversations and thus suggest similar historic conversation flows for new messages.

This document is written for developers, operators and administrators who like to

* *debug, change and contribute* Smarti code,
* *run* Smarti on a local machine,
* *deploy* Smarti on a server and
* *help Smarti* get a better application.

All interested can convince themselves of the documentation quality.
And if you caught fire, maybe you will become a Smarti developer very soon ;-)

IMPORTANT: @all if you find typos, missing sections or if you have any other kind of helpful advice to improve this documentation or *Smarti* in general, please let us know.
Share your thoughts and open an issue right https://github.com/redlink-gmbh/smarti/issues[here].
The *Smarti* community will help you along, as fast as possible.

=== <<index.adoc#_smarti_configuration_guide, How to configure>>
The <<index.adoc#_smarti_configuration_guide, Smarti Configuration>> is done on two levels:

. Since *Smarti* is a https://java.com/[Java] application based on the https://spring.io/[Spring Framework], global application configurations are made using the `application.properties` file.
  Read the <<index.adoc#_application_configuration, Application Configuration>> section to get an overview of Smarti's numerous configuration options.
. Smarti is a multi-client capable system. Therefore each client has its own configuration.
  Client configurations can be manage with Smarti's <<index.adoc#_admin_ui, Admin User Interface>>.
  Alternatively, you can also use the <<index.adoc#_client_configuration_web_service, client configuration API>> to manage your client's configurations.


=== <<index.adoc#_smarti_integration_guide, How to integrate>>
Through Smarti's conversational RESTful-API it can be seamlessly integrated into any Chat-based communication platform.
To learn how to integrate Smarti into chat applications, read the <<index.adoc#_conversational_web_service, Conversational API>> section.

For the time being, Smarti works with https://rocket.chat[Rocket.Chat] conversations, where it can be seamlessly integrated via an https://github.com/assistify/Rocket.Chat[RC plugin].
For more information, see the <<index.adoc#_chat_adapter_web_service, Rocket.Chat adapter API>> description.


=== <<index.adoc#_smarti_troubleshooting_guide, How to troubleshoot>>
In some cases, Smarti will not do what you expect it to do.
You may have encountered a problem that is already known.
In the <<index.adoc#_smarti_troubleshooting_guide, Smarti Troubleshooting Guide>> you will find solutions for known problems
and learn how to get to the bottom of the cause in an unexpected error situation.


=== <<index.adoc#_smarti_developer_guide, How to develop>>
*Smarti* is a https://java.com/[Java]-Application based on the https://spring.io/[Spring Framework].
The application uses https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] as database and http://lucene.apache.org/solr/[Apache Solr] as search engine.
After checking out the sources from https://github.com/redlink-gmbh/smarti/[GitHub] and installing the build components (`ruby`, `ruby-sass`, `ruby-compass`) a build can be executed as simple

```bash
$ mvn clean install [ -Pdeb | -Prpm ]
```
