== Smarti

Smarti is a service component for conversational data. It allows to classify conversation intents, extract entities using
natural language components and makes this data actionable via turning it into queries for an extendable set of endpoints.
In addition Smarti is able to store conversations and thus suggest similar historic conversation flows for new messages.

=== How to install

Installation packages are provided for https://www.debian.org[Debian]- and https://www.redhat.com[RedHat]-based systems. Alternatively the application can
be started by directly launching the executable jar. Check out a detailed <<installation.adoc#Smarti Installation Guide,Smarti Installation Guide>> including system requirements.

=== How to configure

<<configuration.adoc#,Configuration>> is done on two levels:

1. Global <<smartiConfig.adoc#,Smarti configuration>>
2. Client specific configurations using the <<clientConfig.adoc#,the client API>> or the <<client-configuration-ui.adoc#,configuration UI>>, which can be found on the `{HOST}/index.html` page of the the running application.

=== How to integrate

Currently Smarti is working with https://rocket.chat[Rocket.Chat] conversations, where it can be smoothly integrated via a https://github.com/mrsimpson/Rocket.Chat[RC plugin].
