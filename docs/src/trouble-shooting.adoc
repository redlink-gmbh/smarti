=== Troubleshooting

In order of any problems, see also section <<installation.adoc#,System Maintenance>>.
There you will find information about:

* Service Status
* Logging
* Monitoring
* System Health
* System Info

CAUTION: Ensure that the user running Smarti has sufficient permissions on the file system.

```bash
$ sudo chown -R smarti: /var/lib/smarti/ext
$ sudo chmod a+x /var/lib/smarti /var/lib/smarti/ext /var/log/smarti
```

==== System behavior if libs are missing

The system health check: `http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health` will return `{"status":"DOWN"}`.
Additional there are some errors logged during server startup in `/var/log/main.log`

```bash
17:38:41: ERROR RequiredProvidersHealthCheck - Missing Processor: 'stanfordNlpProcessor'
17:38:41: ERROR RequiredProvidersHealthCheck - Missing Processor: 'germanTrueCaseExtractor'
```
