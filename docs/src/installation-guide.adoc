== Smarti Installation Guide

:commonsdir: commons/

The Smarti installation guide is written for developers, operators and administrators who like to run Smarti on a server, as professional service or in production.

include::{commonsdir}system-requirements.adoc[]

=== General recommendations

==== Run Smarti as a service in production

Installation packages are provided for https://www.debian.org/[Debian]- and https://www.redhat.com/[RedHat]-based systems.
As Smarti is a https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] application it can be started by directly launching the executable jar:

```bash
$ java -jar smarti-${smarti-version}-exec.jar
```

IMPORTANT: To run Smarti in production it is recommended to deploy the `deb` or `rpm` package on your target environment instead executing the jar directly.
If you like to setup your development client or a non-productive server read section <<index.adoc#build_and_run, Build and Run>> explains how to do start Smarti by executing the executable jar.

==== Run MongoDB as a dedicated service

IMPORTANT: In a production scenario it is absolutely recommended to run MongoDB on a dedicated system.
If you like to run MongoDB on the same machine as the Smarti application `4 GB` RAM are insufficient.
A developer client should have at least `8 GB` RAM.


=== Deploy / Install

==== Deploy with Docker

```bash
$ docker run -d --name mongodb mongo
$ docker run -d --name smarti --link mongodb:mongo -p 8080:8080 redlinkgmbh/smarti
```

The provided docker-image does not contain some required (GPL-licensed) dependencies. To build a
contained image, use the following snippet:
```bash
$ docker build -t smarti-with-stanfordnlp -<EOF
FROM redlinkgmbh/smarti

USER root
ADD [\
    "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/edu/stanford/nlp/stanford-corenlp/3.8.0/stanford-corenlp-3.8.0.jar", \
    "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/edu/stanford/nlp/stanford-corenlp/3.8.0/stanford-corenlp-3.8.0-models-german.jar", \
    "/opt/ext/"]
RUN chmod -R a+r /opt/ext/
USER smarti
EOF
```

==== Deploy on Debian

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i ${smarti-source}/dist/target/smarti_${smarti-build-version}.deb
```

==== Deploy on Red Hat

```bash
$ sudo rpm -i ${smarti-source}/dist/target/smarti_${smarti-build-version}.rpm
```

==== Installing Additional Components

To install additional components, e.g. Stanford-NLP, add the respective libraries into the folder `/var/lib/smarti/ext`.

Stanford-NLP can be installed using the following command:

```bash
$ wget -P /var/lib/smarti/ext -nH -nd -c \
    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/edu/stanford/nlp/stanford-corenlp/3.8.0/stanford-corenlp-3.8.0.jar \
    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/edu/stanford/nlp/stanford-corenlp/3.8.0/stanford-corenlp-3.8.0-models-german.jar
```

==== Changing the User

When installed using one of the provided packages (`deb`, `rpm`), smarti runs as it's own system user `smarti`. This user is created during the installation
process if it does not already exists.

To run smarti as a different user (`assistify` in this example), do the following steps:

. Create the new working-directory
+
```bash
$ mkdir -p /data/smarti
$ chown -R assistify: /data/smarti
```

. Populate the new working-directory with the required configuration files, e.g. by copying the default settings
+
```bash
$ cp /etc/smarti/* /data/smarti
```

. Update the systemd configuration for smarti
+
```bash
$ systemctl edit smarti
```
+
and add the following content
+
```bash
[Service]
User = assistify
WorkingDirectory = /data/smarti
```

. Restart the smarti
+
```bash
$ systemctl try-restart smarti
```


=== System Maintenance

==== Daemon / Service

===== Configuration

* `/etc/default/smarti`
* JVM and JVM Options (e.g. `-Xmx4g`)
* Program Arguments (overwriting settings from the `application.properties`)

===== Start / Stop / Restart

```bash
$ sudo service smarti [ start | stop | restart  ]
```

===== Status

To check the service status use the daemon

```bash
$ service smarti status
```

This should result in something like

```bash
● smarti.service - smarti
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/smarti.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2017-08-26 12:12:28 UTC; 6s ago
 Main PID: 4606 (bash)
    Tasks: 22
   Memory: 647.8M
      CPU: 12.518s
   CGroup: /system.slice/smarti.service
```

==== Logging

* Working-Directory at `/var/lib/smarti/`
* Log-Files available under `/var/lib/smarti/logs/`, a symlink to `/var/log/smarti/`
* http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html[Log-Configuration] under `/var/lib/smarti/logback.xml`, a symlink to `/etc/smarti/logback.xml`

NOTE: Please keep in mind, that if smarti runs as a different user it probably also has a custom working directory. In such case, logs are stored in the new working directory (or whatever is configured in the logging-configuration).

To Check if Smarti is started search in `/var/log/smarti/main.log` for something like

```bash
[main] INFO  io.redlink.smarti.Application - smarti started: http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/
```

==== Monitoring

===== System Health

A system-wide health check is available at `http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health`.
In case of any problems you can call this URL in your browser or send a `curl` in order to check if Smarti is up and running.

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health
```

On success, if everything is running it returns: `{"status":"UP"}` else `{"status":"DOWN"}`.

NOTE: `{"status":"DOWN"}` is also reported, if Stanford NLP libraries are not present in the classpath.


==== System Info

You can get a detailed information about the build version that is running by calling
```bash
$ curl -X GET http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/info
```

=== Third-Party Dependencies and Licenses

When installing via one of the provided packages (`rpm`, `deb`) a list of used third-party libraries and their licenses are available under

* `/usr/share/doc/smarti/THIRD-PARTY.txt` (backend), and
* `/usr/share/doc/smarti/UI-THIRD-PARTY.json` (frontend, UI)

From the running system, similar files are served.

*Backend*

```bash
$ curl http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/THIRD-PARTY.txt
```

*Frontend UI*

```bash
$ curl http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/3rdPartyLicenses.json
```

=== Configuration

Once Smarti is up and running, go ahead and read the next section <<index.adoc#_application_configuration, Application Configuration>> about Smarti's powerful configuration options.
