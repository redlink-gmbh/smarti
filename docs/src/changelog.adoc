== Smarti 0.6.1 Release Notes
December 7^th^, 2017

Smarti 0.6.1 is a *security feature* release, that also covers several improvements to optimize Smarti's resource consumption behavior.
This is the first Smarti release, that has a *Docker image* as part of its distribution.

Smarti 0.6.1 is 100% compatible to https://github.com/redlink-gmbh/chatpal-search[chatpal.search] - A https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/[Rocket.Chat] package for search with chatpal backend.
So Smarti can be used as cross-channel search engine for https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/[Rocket.Chat].

=== New in Smarti 0.6.1
From the feature perspective Smarti 0.6.1 introduces a simple user management including `FORM` based user authentication as well as `TOKEN` based system authentication.
Users having the role `ADMIN` are allowed to manage clients, configurations, conversations, users and tokens.
Regular Smarti users are only permitted to manage configurations and conversations of specific clients.
Tokens are designed to access the Smarti API by technical systems/users.

The Smarti Admin UI allows you to:

* manage (create, change and delete) users,
* permit users access to specific clients,
* generate tokens to allow technical access,

=== Upgrading

==== Stanford-NLP

For improved memory efficiency, smarti now uses `Stanford-CoreNLP v3.8.0`. If you added the Stanford-NLP dependencies
in previous versions, you must update those libraries.
Please refer to the <<index.adoc#_deploy_install, Installation Guide>> for details.

==== Configuration

The following changes in the configuration files are recommended:

.application.properties
[source,diff]
----
+ nlp.stanfordnlp.de.parseModel=edu/stanford/nlp/models/srparser/germanSR.ser.gz
+ nlp.stanfordnlp.de.parseMaxlen=40

- security.password=
+ security.config.mongo.admin-password=

+ smarti.migration.mongo.script-home=/usr/share/smarti/scripts
----

.logback.xml
[source,diff]
----
- <logger name="io.redlink.nlp" level="DEBUG"/>
+ <logger name="edu.stanford" level="INFO"/>
+ <logger name="io.redlink.nlp" level="INFO"/>
----

Previous client-configurations for `solrsearch`-query-builders might require an update of their `default` settings:
While in previous versions those parameters needed to be url-encoded, this is now happening within the component.

A migration-script is available and applied automatically on starup:

.migrate-04_fix-param-encoding.js
[source,javascript]

=== Upgrading

https://repo.redlink.io/mvn/content/repositories/snapshots/io/redlink/nlp/nlp-stanfordnlp-de/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/[redlink-nlp]
has been upgraded to use https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/[StanfordNLP v3.8]. Please upgrade your locally installed
libraries of `stanford core-nlp`.

==== Configuration

Starting with `0.6.0` recommended conversations (`conversationmlt` and `conversationsearch`) can be
restricted to the same `support_area`. To enable this feature, update the configuration to contain the
following settings:

[source,json]
----
{
  "filter": [
    "support_area"
  ]
}
----

==== Database

With `0.6.0`, the datamodel has changed so data from older installations
must be migrated to the new model.

A migration script is available. When using the installation packages, the migration
will happen automatically on the first startup. Alternatively, the following script
must be applied manually:

.migrate-03_0.5-to-0.6.js
[source,javascript]
