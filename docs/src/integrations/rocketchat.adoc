=== Rocket.Chat Plugin

For now Smarti is working with https://rocket.chat[Rocket.Chat] conversations, where it can be smoothly integrated via a https://github.com/assistify/Rocket.Chat[RC plugin].

  http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/plugin/v1/rocket.chat.js

[NOTE]

====
*TODO*

The Rocket.Chat Plugin consists of three parts:

1. The Rocket.Chat integration code
2. The Smarti backend adapter
3. The Smarti frontend plugin

====

==== Smarti-Rocketchat Step-By-Step Guide
This is a small guide how to get Smarti and Rocket.Chat running.

=== Smarti setup

== Peparation for Smarti
To run Smarti it is recommended to create a specific structure for libraries and configuration files.
The final working-directory should look like this:
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  application.properties
  german-stopwords.txt
  logback.xml
  startup.sh
  ext/
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models-german.jar
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0.jar
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
    crawl-dbsystel.zip
    wikipedia-de.zip
....

In the following steps we will fill the directory with the corresponding files.
As a preparation set up the working-directory with the following filestructure:
....
working-directory/
  ext/
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
....

== Build Smarti 
The first step is to build smarti to get the executable jar.
When run `mvn clean install` a executable jar will be created in the directory: `smarti/application/target/smarti-<version>-exec.jar` +
Copy the `smarti-<version>-exec.jar` in your working-directory (see final working-directory example)
The resulting working-directory should look like this: +
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  ext/
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
....

== Download Stanford NLP
Download the stanford nlp like shown in <<{commonsdir}additional-components.adoc#Enable Stanford NLP,Enable Stanford NLP>> chapter. +
Create a folder named `ext` in the working-directory and move the nlp libraries into the `ext` folder (see final working-directory example).
The resulting working-directory should look like this: +
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  ext/
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models-german.jar
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0.jar
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
....

== Stopwords for Smarti
Stopwords are used from the stanford nlp to filter out meaningless words for the analysis for a specific language. +
Download the following german-stopwords.txt or create your own:
https://github.com/collective/collective.solr/blob/master/etc/german-stopwords.txt[german-stopwords.txt] +
Move the german-stopwords.txt to your working-directory. +
The resulting working-directory should look like this: +
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  german-stopwords.txt
  ext/
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models-german.jar
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0.jar
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
....

== Logback for Smarti
To specify log information for smarti you can use a logback.xml. +
It is recommended to use the following logback.xml: +
....
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<configuration>

    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml"/>

    <logger name="org.springframework.web" level="INFO"/>
    <logger name="org.apache.solr" level="WARN"/>
    <logger name="io.redlink.nlp" level="DEBUG"/>
    <logger name="io.redlink.smarti" level="DEBUG"/>

</configuration>
....
Move the logback.xml into your smarti working-directory.
The resulting working-directory should look like this: +
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  german-stopwords.txt
  logback.xml
  ext/
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models-german.jar
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0.jar
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
....

== Download Solr-ressources (optional)

== Smarti example configuration
Smarti can be configured using a `application.properties`. The `application.properties` must be placed in the same directory the `smarti-<version>-exec.jar` is executed. +
All possible configurations are shown in <<{configurationsdir}application-configuration.adoc#Overview about Spring Boot Configuration, Overview about Spring Boot Configuration>> chapter. +

To get started the following `application.properties` is recommended:
....
### General configuration
logging.config = classpath:logback.xml
server.port = 8080
server.display-name=smarti
#ecurity.password=password
security.enabled=false

### Monitoring
management.context-path=/system
endpoints.enabled=true
endpoints.info.enabled=true
management.info.git.mode=full
endpoints.health.enabled=true
endpoints.metrics.enabled=true

solrcore.wikipedia.de.resource=working-directory/solr_ressources/wikipedia-de.zip
solrcore.crawl.systel.resource=working-directory/solr_ressources/crawl-dbsystel.zip

smarti.analysis.optional=*,!keyword.interestingterms.conversation

### Mongo DB configuration
spring.data.mongodb.database = smarti
spring.session.store-type=mongo
....

[NOTE]
====
The following paths might have to be changed to your local absolut paths: +
solrcore.wikipedia.de.resource +
solrcore.crawl.systel.resource +
====

[NOTE]
====
The admin password for Smarti is autogenerated and shown during startup of Smarti. +
To set a specific password use the following configuration: +
security.password
====

Move the application.properties xinto your smarti working-directory.
The resulting working-directory should look like this: +
....
working-directory/
  smarti-<version>-exec.jar
  german-stopwords.txt
  application.properties
  logback.xml
  ext/
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models-german.jar
    stanford-corenlp-3.6.0.jar
  solrlib/
  solr-ressources/
    crawl-dbsystel.zip
    wikipedia-de.zip
....

== Startup Script for Smarti
To start Smarti it is recommended to use a `startup.sh` script. +
It is recommended to use the following script:
....
#!/bin/bash
java -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n\
     -Dspring.profiles.active=local\
     -Xmx4g -jar -Xdebug smarti-<version>-exec.jar\
     --solrlib.home=solrlib
....

[NOTE]
====
In order to use the script the exact version of the smarti-<version>-exec.jar has to be specified
====

== Remote Debugging
It is possible to debug the Smarti application remotely by using a debugging port when starting Smarti. +
The port can be specified with `address=8787` (see Startup Script for Smarti) when executing the jar file. +
In your IDE you can set up a remote debugger for Smarti and connect to the smarti host (localhost) with the specified port (8787).

To avoid debugging problems make sure the smarti<version>-exec.jar has the same version as the remotely debugged project.

=== Rocket.Chat setup

== Update packages
Before building Rocket.Chat all dependent node packages need to be installed. +
Run `meteor npm install` to install missing dependencies.

== Build Rocket.Chat
To run Rocket.Chat switch into the project directory and run `meteor`

== Build Rocket.Chat for deployment
To build Rocket.Chat for deployment use the following command: +
`meteor build --server-only <target-directory>` +
This will build Rocket.Chat and create an tar.gz file. +
Switch to the `target-directory` and extract the Rocket.Chat.tar.gz file on the deployment platform. +
Change directory to `bundle/programs/server` and run `meteor npm install` again. +
Rocket.Chat is ready to run now.

[NOTE]
====
There might accur an error related to `google-vision`. +
Switch to `npm/node_modules/meteor/rocketchat_google-vision` and run `meteor npm install grpc` in order to fix this error.
====

== Setup environment configuration
Rocket.Chat can be configured using environment variables. +
Here are some useful variables to configure the startup of Rocket.Chat: +
