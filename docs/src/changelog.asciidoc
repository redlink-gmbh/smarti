=== Upgrading

==== Stanford-NLP

For improved memory efficiency, smarti now uses `Stanford-CoreNLP v3.8.0`. If you added the Stanford-NLP dependencies
in previous versions, you must update those libraries.
Please refer to the <<index.adoc#_deploy_install, Installation Guide>> for details.

==== Configuration

The following changes in the configuration files are recommended:

.application.properties
[source,diff]
----
+ nlp.stanfordnlp.de.parseModel=edu/stanford/nlp/models/srparser/germanSR.ser.gz
+ nlp.stanfordnlp.de.parseMaxlen=40

- security.password=
+ security.config.mongo.admin-password=

+ smarti.migration.mongo.script-home=/usr/share/smarti/scripts
----

.logback.xml
[source,diff]
----
- <logger name="io.redlink.nlp" level="DEBUG"/>
+ <logger name="edu.stanford" level="INFO"/>
+ <logger name="io.redlink.nlp" level="INFO"/>
----

Previous client-configurations for `solrsearch`-query-builders might require an update of their `default` settings:
While in previous versions those parameters needed to be url-encoded, this is now happening within the component.

A migration-script is available and applied automatically on starup:

.migrate-04_fix-param-encoding.js
[source,javascript]
----
include::{migration_scripts}/migrate-04_fix-param-encoding.js[lines=112..-1]
