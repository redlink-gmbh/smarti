== Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

THis FAQs are addressing common concerns, questions or objections that might come up to your mind, when get into touch with Smarti development.

=== Administration

==== What value should be passed by the chat as 'clientID'?

Since Smarti has a multi client architecture a per 'customer' configuration is required.

In Smarti `Client` is used to represent customer information. Each `Client` has a unique
`name` (`[a-z0-9-_\.:]+`).

For the Rocket.Chat integration this `name` MUST BE configured as `clientId` (versions `< 0.7`)

All conversations refer exact one client. This concept enables to protect conversation
access across clients.

=== Integration and API

==== Do I have to wait for the webhook's response after sending a 'POST/rocket/{clientId}'

For Smarti versions before `0.7` the retrieval of processing and query results

```
GET /conversation/{id}/template
GET /conversation/{id}/template/{template}/{creator}
```

is complete only when the processing of the webhook has been completed.

Messages, can be transmitted at any time at any frequency and speed.

Smarti `v0.7` will introduce a revamped webservice API where updates for conversations will
be synchronous and requests for processing results will allow for both synchronous and
asynchronous execution via webhook's

==== Should I only send the customer's messages to Smarti API or should I send messages from the agents as well?

All messages of a conversation should be sent to the Smarti API. Messages of agents do
also contain keywords, entities, etc. Including those is important for both suggestions and
conversation search.

==== Could you please describe the workflow for interacting with the conversational API?

NOTE: this describes the workflow until `v0.6.*`

. The Rocket.Chat server sends the message to Rocket.Chat Endpoint of Smarti `POST /rocket/{clientId}`.
. Smarti answers to the chat server via a web hook as soon as the processing of the message has been completed.
. call `GET /conversation/{conversationId}/template` and extracts the correct values for `template` and `creator` from the result.
.. call `GET /conversation/{conversationId}/template/{template}/{creator}` to execute a the query provided by the `creator` based on the `template`
.. or use the information provided by the `template.query` to directly execute the query

Smarti Integration Guide

==== Why do sent messages do not appear as suggestions, even if I enter the same question?

A conversation consists of multiple messages send by different `callers`. In oder to make
a conversation available as suggestion, it needs to be published.
In Rocket.Chat this happens when a room is closed, but if this is not the case one can
manually trigger publish a conversation by calling:

```
POST /conversation/{conversationId}/publish
```

NOTE: After a conversation is published a new conversation will be automatically created
on the next message sent to a room.


=== Knowledge Base

==== Do suggestions always refer to the last message within a conversation?

Currently (`v0.6.*)` suggestions always refer to the entire conversation. By default a
conversation is the sum of all messages within a room.

As long as every single message of a conversation has been sent to Smarti, all of them are
considered by Smarti for retrieving suggestions.

This might change in future version through as rules (e.g. ageing, classification, ...)
might be introduced the automatically split messages in a room to different conversations.
