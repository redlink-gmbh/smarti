=== Additional components

Due to licensing-issues (e.g. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html[GPL]), some optional dependencies are not part of the distribution packages.
To enable these additional modules, you need to put the missing libraries into the `ext`-folder in the working directory.

When installed with the provided `deb` or `rpm` package, this folder is located at `/var/lib/smarti/ext` by default and contains a simple readme.

.plugin-info.txt
:sourcedir: ../../dist/src/main/resources/
[source,txt]
----
include::{sourcedir}/plugin-info.txt[]
----

IMPORTANT: *For developers:* When running Smarti by directly executing the jar file, you need to create the `ext` directory relative to the location where the `java` command is executed `${smarti-work-dir}/ext`.

CAUTION: Make sure the user that is running the `java` process has the right permissions on the file system.
In case you run into trouble, read the section <<troubleshooting-guide.adoc#, Troubleshooting>>.
