[abstract]
Smarti is a service component for conversational data. It allows to classify conversation intents, extract entities using
natural language components and makes this data actionable via turning it into queries for an extendable set of endpoints.
In addition Smarti is able to store conversations and thus suggest similar historic conversation flows for new messages.

This document is written for developers, operators and administrators who like to

* *debug, change and contribute* Smarti code,
* *run* Smarti on a local machine,
* *deploy* Smarti on a server and
* *help Smarti* get a better application.

All interested can convince themselves of the documentation quality.
And if you caught fire, maybe you will become a Smarti developer very soon ;-)

IMPORTANT: @all if you find typos, missing sections or if you have any other kind of helpful advice to improve this documentation or *Smarti* in general, please let us know.
Share your thoughts and open an issue right https://github.com/redlink-gmbh/smarti/issues[here].
The *Smarti* community will help you along, as fast as possible.
