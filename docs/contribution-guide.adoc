== Smarti Contribution Guide

Smarti is an Open Source project so everyone is encouraged to improve it. Don't hesitate to report bugs, provide fixes or
share new ideas with us. We have various ways for contribution:

* use the issue tracker - report bugs, suggest features or give hints how we can improve the documentation.
* discuss issues with the community - two brains are better than one.
* write code - no patch is too small. So even fixing typos helps to improve Smarti.
