== Smarti Troubleshooting Guide

In some cases, Smarti will not do what you expect it to do.
Maybe you have encountered an issue that is already known.
If so, this is the place to be for resolving the problem.

=== General advices

==== System requirements

Only if the <<installation-guide.adoc#_system_requirements,System Requirements>> are fulfilled, Smarti will work correctly.
E.g. in case of too little memory the system will behave in an unexpected way.

CAUTION: Ensure the machine running Smarti has at least 4GB of RAM!

CAUTION: Ensure your JVM has allocated enough memory for heap space by using the `-Xmx4g` option.


==== System information

In case of any problems, it is important to know how to analyze your system.
Also if you like to report a bug it is quite necessary for other people, willing to help you, that you provide information about your environment and the setup.

TIP: Read section <<installation-guide.adoc#_system_maintenance,System maintenance>> to learn more about:
Logging, Monitoring, System Health, System Info Start/Stop.

IMPORTANT: Know your system: platform, operating system, runtime environment, software components and release versions.


=== External libraries not found or not readable

==== Exception

If external dependencies of Smarti are not in the class path of the JVM, the system health check:

```
http://${smarti-host}:${smarti-port}/system/health
```
will return `{"status":"DOWN"}`. Additional there are some errors logged during server startup in `main.log` like:

```
ERROR RequiredProvidersHealthCheck - Missing Processor: 'stanfordNlpProcessor'
ERROR RequiredProvidersHealthCheck - Missing Processor: 'germanTrueCaseExtractor'
```

==== Impact

If external libs are not in the class path of a running Smarti instance, the system will boot up anyway.
For example, if the Stanford NLP libs are missing, the text analysis will not work.
In this case Smarti can not analyze conversations correctly and also the suggested messages will not fit.

==== Reason

This problem can be caused by

* forgotten to download the jars,
* downloaded the jars to a wrong location
* insufficient permissions on the file system


==== Solution

. *Download the external libraries*
+
[CAUTION]
====
Ensure correct version and make sure they are in the class path.
```bash
$ cd ${working-dir}/ext
$ wget ${ext-file-name}
```
====

. *Check the permissions*
+
[CAUTION]
====
Ensure that the user running Smarti has sufficient permissions on the file system.
```bash
$ sudo chown -R smarti: /var/lib/smarti/ext
$ sudo chmod a+x /var/lib/smarti /var/lib/smarti/ext /var/log/smarti
====

. *Read more about additional components*
+
NOTE: Read also section <<commons/additional-components.adoc#,Additional components>>.

=== Running Smarti on a container
bzip missing

=== Not enough memory @build_time

=== Not enough memory @run_time
